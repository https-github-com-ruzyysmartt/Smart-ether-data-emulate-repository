## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/https://github/ruzyysmartt/Smart-ether-data-emulate-repository.gits) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ruzyysmartt/Smart-ether-data-emulate-repository) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ruzyysmartt/Ruzyysmartt-ether-Web3/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
